# Piglin Origins
This is an Origins addon using the same mechanics from [MoriyaShiine's Piglin Origin within Extra Origins](https://github.com/MoriyaShiine/extra-origins)
Some compromises had to be made as a result of datapack limitations

## Changes:
- Removal of Piglin Neutrality
- Homesick zombification will happen, no matter what after 1 minute. After that the player receives a weakness 2 debuff, fire resistance and water breathing buffs for 30 minutes.
- Probably some other numbers that got messed up due to lack of understanding of how datapacks work compared to having full access to the Fabric API

## Why was this made?
I made this just so that a friend can play their preffered Origins (Forge port).
